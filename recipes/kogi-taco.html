    <p>
        Kogi beef tacos are an iconic piece of LA food culture.
        They are the product of a beautiful fusion between the timeless
        <em>Mexican</em> taco and the vibrant <em> Korean </em> taste. 
        I challenge you to find somone who does not love these!

<ul> <strong>Beef Preperation Ingredients</strong>
    <li>12-15 small taco tortillas</li>
    <li>3 pounds of beef short ribs</li>
    <li>1 cup of soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of sesame oil</li>
    <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>6 scallions</li>
    <li>2 tsps of peeled + grated ginger</li>
</ul>

    <ul> <strong>Korean-Style Slaw Ingredients</strong>
    <li>3 cups of chopped Napa cabbage</li>
    <li>1 cup matchstick-size daikon slices</li>
    <li>3 tbps of chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>6 scallions diced</li>
</ul>

<ol> <strong>Directions</strong>
    <li>Cut off excess fat and thinly slice beef into small strips.
    Place beef into plastic container or resealable bag.</li>


    <li>In a blender or food processor, blend the soy sauce, mirin, 
    sugar, sesame oil, garlic, scallions and ginger. 
    Pour half of the sauce over the short ribs, ensuring all the 
    beef is covered. Seal tightly and marinate the short ribs 
    in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours. </li>

    <li>Place the other half of the marinade in a pan and reduce 
        over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is 
        thick. Place in a serving bowl and reserve to drizzle on the 
        tacos. </li>

    <li>For the slaw: Place the cabbage, daikon, cilantro 
            and scallions together in a medium to large bowl. </li>

    <li>For the taco assembly: Heat your griddle to high. 
                Flash cook the meat while simultaneously caramelizing 
                the marinade. Place your short ribs on the griddle. 
                Cook for 2 to 3 minutes and flip. Cook an additional 
                3 minutes, then wrap the meat in foil and set aside. 
            </li>

    <li>On the grilled tortillas, pile some Korean slaw, dressing, beef, 
                reserved and reduced marinade and extra Sriracha to 
                taste. Then, chow down. </li>
            </ol>
